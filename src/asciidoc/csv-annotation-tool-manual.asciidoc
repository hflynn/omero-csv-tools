[[overview]]
== Introduction to OMERO annotations

[[overview-omero-annotations]]
=== OMERO and structured annotations

Examples of how you can annotate your data as an OMERO user:

* Tag, rate or comment on your projects / datasets / images individually using the graphical user interface in OMERO.insight or OMERO.web.
* Let the webtagging tool automatically suggest tags from your image names for you to review and apply interactively in OMERO.web.
* Bulk annotate your datasets (and soon images) in an unattended manner using the CSV tool script in OMERO.insight or OMERO.web.

For general usage of annotations in OMERO, please see the LOCI tutorial at

=== OMERO webtagging

For detailed instructions on how to use the webtagging tool, please see the tool's documentation at

[[overview-omero-cat]]
=== OMERO CSV annotation tool

Workflow outline (details below): 

. Attach the tag definitions in CSV format to your OMERO project.
. Run the CSV annotation tool script on the project.

== CSV annotation tool usage guidelines

[[supported-omero-cat]]
=== Supported features

The CSV tool currently allows:

* tagging Datasets nested _within_ a Project (ie. ``orphans'' or ``top-level'' datasets are currently not supported, but may be at a later stage)
* attaching the CSV file to a Project (similarily, Datastets may be supported later on)

[[conventions-omero-cat]]
=== Data management conventions

==== Tags file name

If you don't use a specific file name, a default naming scheme is applied.

The default name will be: *+<annotated-type>_<annotation-type>.csv+*, with *+annotated-type*+ and *+annotation-type*+
being the supported script arguments.

Example default file names:

* File containing at list one _tag_  to be applied to at least one _dataset_: *dataset_tag.csv*
* File containing at list one _tag_  to be applied to at least one _image_: *image_tag.csv*

The file content is consequently expected to be of homogenous nature: you cannot mix tags to be applied to images
and datasets in the same file (you would need two files for this).

==== Tags file format

The CSV format is expected to be in the form of:

* An optional column header (ignored by default)
* A line per tagging request, with:
  ** The dataset name as the first column
  ** Any number of tags names as the remaning columns (at least one)

Other default file format parameters which you can customise are:

[width="25%"]
|====================================
|Parameter            |Default value
|Ignore columns header|true
|Delimiter character  |Comma (,)
|Character encoding   | UTF-8
|====================================

==== Example files

* Example CSV file using the default comma delimiter and a column header (link:files/dataset_tag.csv[download])

----
Dataset Name, Type, Gender
dataset_01, ControlSubject, Female
dataset_02, Male
----

* Example CSV file using an alternate semicolon delimiter and no header (link:files/dataset_tag_semicolon_noheader.csv[download])

----
dataset_01;ControlSubject;Female
dataset_02;Male
----

=== Usage tutorial

==== Upload CSV tags file

Attach your tag file to your OMERO Project, either with the default name or a name of your choice.
