TODO items
------------

- review & harmonize log levels
- investigate potential simplifications with custom queries
- improve user error reporting for OMERO script
- pre-fetch available attachment file names in OMERO script
- probably remove dry-run mode from OMERO script
- define policy for database names with trailing/leading whitespace: trim or keep as is (current)
- more unit & integration tests (executable independently via gradle, split into separate directories)
- code cleanup, javadoc
- review distribution zip layout (with bin, docs, lib folders)
- finalize user manual
- restrict the set of csv delimiters? (enum)
